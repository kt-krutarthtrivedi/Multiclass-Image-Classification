# Multiclass-Image-Classification

## Aim
To build a 2-layer Softmax Neural Network and a fully connected CNN (Convolution Neural Network) for multiclass image classification, and compare their performances on Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Dataset

[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Here's an example of how the data looks (each class takes three-rows):

## Results

- Using 2-Layer Softmax Neural Network, the highest accuracy we achieved is 85.34%
